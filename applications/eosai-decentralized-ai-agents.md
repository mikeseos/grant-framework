# EOS Network Foundation Grant Application

## Project Name
EOSAI – Decentralized AI Agents for On-Chain Automation

## Project Description
EOSAI is an open-source framework that enables the creation and deployment of decentralized AI agents designed to autonomously interact with smart contracts on the EOS blockchain. These lightweight agents are capable of executing deterministic rule-based logic, integrating off-chain AI inference where needed, and enabling next-generation automation for DeFi, NFTs, DAOs, and governance processes on EOS.

EOSAI’s core goal is to empower developers and dApp creators to build intelligent, self-operating systems that drive engagement, reduce overhead, and enhance the utility of the EOS ecosystem.

## Relevant Experience
Lead developer with experience in AI integration, blockchain infrastructure, and open-source tools. Former media tech entrepreneur with a history of delivering lightweight developer SDKs and smart contract automation tools. Contributor to crypto-related automation projects and backend AI workflows.

## Project Goals
- Provide an SDK for building EOS-compatible decentralized agents (TypeScript + Python)
- Deploy an EOS smart contract that registers, manages, and schedules agent operations
- Enable optional integration with external AI APIs (e.g. OpenAI, open models) via secure off-chain oracles
- Launch a minimal frontend dashboard to configure and deploy agents
- Deliver working sample agents (e.g. auto-yield switcher, NFT market monitor, DAO voter)
